            <p class="text">Take a stand with people of color and fight for justice. Fight against the pain and discrimination they have experienced for centuries. Show the world we are progressing and we are all humans who deserve love and equality.</p>
            <p class="text">Take a stand with the LGBTQ+ community. Show your support to equality for all no matter what they look like or who they love. Everyone deserves to love and have a family.</p>
            <p class="text">Biden 2020! This is a turning point. A hurtful man was in power and is now gone and replaced by someone who will listen to our needs for equality and justice. Plus, we have our first black female vice president. But we are not done yet, this is just one of the many steps to peace.</p>
            <p class="text">As Bill Nye the Science Guy is saying, This is an actual crisis. Our world, our home is melting before our eyes. Save the earth by recycling and throwing your trash into the trashbin and not the floor.</p>

            <p class="text"> We know that being inside <br>
                can get you down and in <br>
                case you didn't hear these words today, here they<br>
                are! "Just a little reminder in case your mind is playing tricks on you today: You matter. You're important. You're loved. And your presense in this earth makes a difference whether you see it or not."❤️🌺💯</p>
